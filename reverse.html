        <p>Offhand, I can’t think of when I needed to reverse a number, but I know there’s been an occasion or two. With a dynamically typed language like ruby, it’s easy to simply convert the number to a string class object and use the built in .reverse method. I probably did that when it came up, and thought nothing of it.</p>
        <p>At school yesterday, I had a chance to meet with one of my mentors, and he brought up using a mathematical solution to this problem. It was just an offhand comment in the course of a larger conversation, but it made me think about the problem, and I wanted to learn what the better solution might be.</p>
        <p>If we define a ruby method to solve this the int to string to int way, it would look something like this:</p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-rb">
        def reverse_as_string(num)
          num.to_s.reverse.to_i
        end
        </pre>
        <p>That’s pretty simple. Let’s do it the other way.</p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-rb">
        def reverse_num(num)
         reversed = 0
         until num == 0
           last_digit = num % 10
           reversed = (reversed * 10) + last_digit
           num = num / 10
         end
         reversed
        end
        </pre>
        <p>That’s all well and good, but what was interesting about this problem in the first place was efficiency. How do these two approaches stack up?</p>

        <p>Let’s benchmark them side by side.</p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-rb">
          array = Array.new(10000000) { rand 1..10000000 }

          Benchmark.bmbm do |x|
          x.report("string:")   { array.each { |i| reverse_as_string(i) } }
          x.report("math:") { array.each { |i| reverse_num(i) } }
          end
        </pre>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-rb">
          Rehearsal -------------------------------------------
          string:   3.910000   0.050000   3.960000 (  4.020166)
          math:     5.990000   0.070000   6.060000 (  6.154384)
          --------------------------------- total: 10.020000sec

                        user     system      total        real
          string:   3.890000   0.050000   3.940000 (  4.001591)
          math:     5.700000   0.070000   5.770000 (  5.852306)
        </pre>
        <p>That was not what I expected! The to_s approach actually outperformed the mathematical approach by about 50%. I will certainly concede that I’m very likely missing a more efficient way to do this mathematically, and if you have some ideas, leave me a comment. I’d be happy to rerun benchmarks and update this post with better solutions.</p>
