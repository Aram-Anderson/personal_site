        <p>I finished Module 1 at <a href="https://www.turing.io/">Turing</a> last week. It feels good to have done that, and some of my anxiety around the program has gone. Certainly not all of it, but some. It was hard. I feel like that is obvious, and I knew that going in, but difficulty was something abstract prior to beginning the program. It’s a reality now, and it was hard in discrete ways.</p>

        <p>One of the struggles I had was organization. It seems obvious in retrospect that programming would require a great deal of organization, but in the projects I’d built before, I’d never really hit that wall. I think I’d simply never built anything big enough that it mattered too much. Method names. Damn those things. Building an ORM from the ground up, there are so many method names, and they’re all doing something similar enough that it gets really hard to name them in ways that are concise and readable.</p>

        <p>I went into Turing with the idea that I kind of live there for the next seven months. I know that’s not something everyone can do, but that was my attitude. I feel like I’ve been granted an amazing opportunity, and it’s my goal to get as much out of it as I possibly can. If that means I don’t have a life outside Turing for the duration, that’s a reasonable trade in my mind. I am very aware that I’m in a privileged position in my ability to dedicate myself to this. I don’t have children, and I don’t have many obligations at the moment. I understand that not everyone can make that commitment.</p>

        <p>One of the parts of Turing that really surprised me is the community. I knew going in that they have community as a core part of the program, but again, that seemed really abstract until I had the experience. The school does an amazing job at fostering a welcoming and accepting community. I felt very comfortable right away. It really feels completely fine to walk up to a stranger and ask for some help with a problem. I was amazed at how open and gracious the people there are. It really wouldn’t be the same without that part of the experience, and whatever they’re doing, they seem to have figured out the formula.</p>
